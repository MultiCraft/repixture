Note: Do not use mapgen v6, it is not supported and will fail. Use v5 or v7 instead.

Mapgen:
    Seeds that give good results with mapgen v7(Biomes have changed since, these seeds may not work):
        "wl":
            Usually spawns you in a savanna with a tall mountain and village nearby.
            Some grassland and wastelands.
        "pt":
            Usually spawns you near a tall mountain and deep forests.
            Use the chatcommand "/teleport 200 5 150" to get to a flat forested area.
        "qwerty":
            Usually spawns you in some flat grasslands that have a high chance of
              spawning villages nearby.
        "beach":
            Usually spawns you on a small beach area with gravel beaches and cliffs nearby,
              and a village also spawns at the same place.
	"wilderness":
            At 590, 30, 350 and -100, 11, 200
            Wilderness biome and a village
