## Project Notes

This game works for Minetest 5.0.0. It's a fork of Pixture 0.1.1.
The goal of Pixture Revival is to make Pixture work properly in
latest Minetest versions.
The original gameplay of Pixture will be preserved, only bugfixes
and usability features will be added.

## Bugs and problems

- Villages sometimes have huge landmasses or floating treecaps above them
