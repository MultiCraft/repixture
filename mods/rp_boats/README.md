# Boats

This mod adds simple boats.

## Boat behavior

* Use “place” key on boat to mount, use it again to unmount
* Punch/attack boat multiple times to make it drop as an item
* Boat floats on water, can't move on other blocks
* Boat will sink when inside water

## Boat controls

Once you've entered a boat, use these controls:

* Left/Right: Rotate
* Up: Speed up
* Down: Slow down
* Sneak: Get off boat
* "Place" key on boat: Get off boat
