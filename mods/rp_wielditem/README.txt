Wielditem mod
==============
By Kaadmy and Wuzzy, for Repixture.

Shows the wield item in 3rd person view.

## For developers

If an item does not show up correctly in 3rd person view (bad rotation),
add `_rp_wielditem_rotation` to the node definition and set it to a rotation value
(between 0 and 360 degrees).
