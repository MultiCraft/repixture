Normally, you don't need to do anything special for this mod to work,
most items will show up correctly in 3rd person view.

Sometimes, an item might show up with the wrong rotation in 3rd person view,
so a correct angle has to be specified.

To do this, add `_rp_wielditem_rotation` to the node definition and set it
to a rotation value (between 0 and 360 degrees).
