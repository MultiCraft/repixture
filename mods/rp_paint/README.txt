Repixure core mod: rp_paint
===========================
By Wuzzy, for Repixture.

Adds paint. Color nodes with a paint bucket and a paint brush.
Many nodes can be painted, but not all.
There are 19 colors.

## Usage

Paint is limited, but the color of paint can be changed for free.

The paint bucket needs flowers to create paint. Paint is created
either by crafting or by placing flowers into a paint bucket.

Paint buckets must be placed.
Rightclick paint bucket to cycle through colors.
Look at the left or right side of the bucket to select the previous
or next color.

Paint brush needs paint from paint bucket to work.
Dip paint brush into paint bucket to pick color,
punch nodes with paint brush to paint with that color.
Paint brush will dry out eventually, so you must dip into paint
bucket again. Each dip will reduce the amount of paint in the
paint bucket so you need to refill it with flowers.

Dip paint brush into water bucket to clear its color.

Punch paint bucket with a paint bucket on hand to
take paint from or put paint into the pointed paint bucket.

Place axe on painted blocks to scrape off the paint.
