# Show Wielded Item [`show_wielded_item`]
This Luanti mod displays the name of the wielded item above the hotbar and
statbars.

This mod is compatible with the HUD Bars [`hudbars`] mod.
This mod *disables* itself if Unified Inventory is detected to show item names.
Compatibility with other HUD-related mods is possible, but not guaranteed.

Version: 1.2.1 (modified for Repixture)
